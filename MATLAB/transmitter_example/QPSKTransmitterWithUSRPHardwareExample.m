%% QPSK Transmitter with USRP(TM) Hardware
% This example shows how to use the Universal Software Radio Peripheral(TM)
% (USRP) device using SDRu (Software Defined Radio USRP) System objects to
% implement a QPSK transmitter. The USRP device in this system will keep
% transmitting indexed "Hello world" messages at its specified center
% frequency and at bit rate of 2Mbps. You can demodulate the transmitted
% message using the <docid:usrpradio_ug#example-sdruQPSKReceiver QPSK
% Receiver with USRPÂ® Hardware> example with an additional USRP device.
%
% Please refer to the Setup and Configuration section of
% <docid:usrpradio_ug#bue1zea-1 Guided USRP Radio Support Package Hardware
% Setup> for details on configuring your host computer to work with the
% SDRu Transmitter System object.

%% Implementations
% This example describes the MATLAB(R) implementation of a QPSK transmitter

%% Introduction
% This example has the following motivation:
%
% * To implement a real QPSK-based transmission-reception environment in
% MATLAB using SDRu System objects.
%
% * To illustrate the use of key Communications Toolbox(TM) System
% objects for QPSK system design.
%
% In this example, the transmitter generates a message using ASCII  
% characters, converts the characters to bits, and prepends a Barker code
% for receiver frame synchronization. This data is then modulated using
% QPSK and filtered with a square root raised cosine filter. The filtered
% QPSK symbols can be transmitted over the air using the SDRu transmitter
% System object and the USRP hardware. 

%% Discover Radio
% Discover radio(s) connected to your computer. This example uses the first
% USRP radio found using the |findsdru| function. Check if the radio is
% available and record the radio type. If no available radios are found,
% the example uses a default configuration for the system.

connectedRadios = findsdru;
if strncmp(connectedRadios(1).Status, 'Success', 7)
  platform = connectedRadios(1).Platform;
  switch connectedRadios(1).Platform
    case {'B200','B210'}
      address = connectedRadios(1).SerialNum;
    case {'N200/N210/USRP2','X300','X310','N300','N310','N320/N321'}
      address = connectedRadios(1).IPAddress;
  end
else
  address = '192.168.10.2';
  platform = 'N200/N210/USRP2';
end

%% Initialization
% <matlab:openExample('usrpradio/QPSKTransmitterWithUSRPHardwareExample','supportingFile','sdruqpsktransmitter_init.m')
% sdruqpsktransmitter_init.m> script initializes the simulation parameters
% and generates the structure prmQPSKTransmitter.

compileIt  = false; % true if code is to be compiled for accelerated execution 
useCodegen = false; % true to run the latest generated mex file

% Transmitter parameter structure
prmQPSKTransmitter = sdruqpsktransmitter_init(platform, useCodegen)
prmQPSKTransmitter.Platform = platform;
prmQPSKTransmitter.Address = address;
%%
% To achieve a successful transmission, ensure that the specified center
% frequency of the SDRu Transmitter is within the acceptable range of your
% USRP daughterboard.
%
% Also, by using the compileIt and useCodegen flags, you can interact with
% the code to explore different execution options.  Set the MATLAB variable
% compileIt to true in order to generate C code; this can be
% accomplished by using the *codegen* command provided by the MATLAB
% Coder(TM) product. The *codegen* command compiles MATLAB(R) functions to
% a C-based static or dynamic library, executable, or MEX file, producing
% code for accelerated execution. The generated executable runs several times
% faster than the original MATLAB code. Set useCodegen to true to run the
% executable generated by *codegen* instead of the MATLAB code.

%% Code Architecture
% The function runSDRuQPSKTransmitter implements the QPSK transmitter using
% two System objects, QPSKTransmitter and comm.SDRuTransmitter. 
%
% *QPSK Transmitter*
%
% The transmitter includes the *Bit Generation*, *QPSK Modulator* and
% *Raised Cosine Transmit Filter*  objects. The *Bit Generation*
% object generates the data frames. The Barker code is sent on both in-phase and
% quadrature components of the QPSK modulated symbols. This is achieved by
% repeating the Barker code bits twice before modulating them with the QPSK
% modulator.
%
% The remaining bits are the payload. The payload contains 100 'Hello world
% ###' messages, where '###' is an increasing sequence of '000', '001', ...
% '099' in binary forms. The number of messages is tunable via the
% initialization file, namely
% <matlab:openExample('usrpradio/QPSKTransmitterWithUSRPHardwareExample','supportingFile','sdruqpsktransmitter_init.m')
% transmitter initialization file>. Please make corresponding changes in
% the receiver initialization file,
% <matlab:openExample('usrpradio/QPSKReceiverWithUSRPHardwareExample','supportingFile','sdruqpskreceiver_init.m')
% receiver initialization file>. The payload is then scrambled to guarantee
% a balanced distribution of zeros and ones for the timing recovery
% operation in the receiver object. The scrambled bits are modulated by the
% *QPSK Modulator* (with Gray mapping). The *Raised Cosine Transmit Filter*
% upsamples the modulated symbols by two, and has roll-off factor of 0.5.
% The output rate of the *Raised Cosine Filter* is set to be 400k samples
% per second with a symbol rate of 200k symbols per second. If MATLAB
% Coder(TM) is enabled, the output symbol rate is 500k symbols per second.
% Please match the symbol rate of the transmitter model and the receiver
% model correspondingly.
%
% *SDRu Transmitter*
%
% The host computer communicates with the USRP radio using the SDRu
% transmitter System object. The CenterFrequency, Gain, and
% InterpolationFactor arguments are set by the parameter variable
% prmQPSKTransmitter.

%% Execution
% Before running the script, first turn on the USRP radio and connect it to
% the computer. As already mentioned, you can check the correct data
% transmission by running the
% <matlab:openExample('usrpradio/QPSKReceiverWithUSRPHardwareExample') QPSK
% Receiver with USRP Hardware> example while running the transmitter
% script.

if compileIt
    codegen('runSDRuQPSKTransmitter', '-args', {coder.Constant(prmQPSKTransmitter)}); %#ok<UNRCH>
end
if useCodegen
   clear runSDRuQPSKTransmitter_mex %#ok<UNRCH>
   runSDRuQPSKTransmitter_mex(prmQPSKTransmitter);
else
   runSDRuQPSKTransmitter(prmQPSKTransmitter);
end
%%
% The gain behavior of different USRP daughter boards varies
% considerably. Thus, the gain setting in the transmitter and receiver
% defined in this example may not be well suited for your daughter boards.
% If the message is not properly decoded by the receiver object, you can
% vary the gain of the source signals in the *SDRu Transmitter* and *SDRu
% Receiver* System objects by changing the SimParams.USRPGain value in the
% <matlab:openExample('usrpradio/QPSKTransmitterWithUSRPHardwareExample','supportingFile','sdruqpsktransmitter_init.m')
% transmitter initialization file> and in the
% <matlab:openExample('usrpradio/QPSKReceiverWithUSRPHardwareExample','supportingFile','sdruqpskreceiver_init.m')
% receiver initialization file>.
%
% Also, a large relative frequency offset between the transmit and receive
% USRP radios can prevent the receiver functions from properly decoding
% the message. If that happens, you can determine the offset by sending a
% tone at a known frequency from the transmitter to the receiver, then
% measuring the offset between the transmitted and received frequency, then
% applying that offset to the center frequency of the SDRu Receiver System
% object.
